            <div id="mainpanel">Git is used my developers as a method of version control, it allows the developer to add features to an application and add aditional features while still having the original working framework and allows multiple developers to work on the same code at the same time.
              
                It does this by allowing the developer to create branches from the original (or main) code, these branches can be worked on and any mistakes will not affect the main code. Any changes to the code can be saved as a commit, this allows the developer to go back if any mistakes are made. Git will assign each commit a unique ID called a SHA or hash. 
              
                Once a developer is happy with the changes they have made they can make a pull request to amend the code to the changed code this can then be reviewed by other developers before the change is confirmed and submitted back to the main branch.
