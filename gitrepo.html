                Git is used my developers as a method of version control, it allows the developer to add features to an application and add aditional features while still having the original working framework and allows multiple developers to work on the same code at the same time.
                It does this by allowing the developer to create branches from the original (or main) code, these branches can be worked on and any mistakes will not affect the main code. Any changes to the code can be saved as a commit, this allows the developer to go back if any mistakes are made. Git will assign each commit a unique ID called a SHA or hash. 
               Once a developer is happy with the changes they have made they can make a pull request to amend the code to the changed code this can then be reviewed by other developers before the change is confirmed and submitted back to the main branch.
               
               The Unix shell is a command and scripting language  and is used by operating systems, a user may interact with a Unix shell using  a terminal emulator such as Gitbash. 
               A user may want to interact with the Unix shell to look in the infrastucure of the machine and navigate through the machines directories.
               It is important for us to be able to interperit and amend the Unix shell so that we can create repositories that link to  git hub.
               When using Gitbash, to list the files and directories in your current location you can use the comand ls. This will list all the available files you can the move further into the infrastructure by using the comand cd followed by the new directory such as 
               CD onedrive
               You can make completelly new directories by using the comand mkdir like below
               mkdir workstuff
               This will create a directory in your current location, much like with directories you can create new files by using the comand nano like this
               nano readme.md
               and to remove a file simply use the comand rm like below
               rm readme.md
                </div>
